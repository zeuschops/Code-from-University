# Capstone
A CLI application designed to assist students and their counselors with understanding what their grade average means and what projections look like for individual students, classes, or instructors.

## Setup
Run `python3 TableDataGenerator.py` to generate a table with some useful data in it, then proceed to the application by running `python3 Main.py`.

Note: These steps require you to be in the Capstone directory, and have Python 3.x installed.
